Q.3 	
	There is no benefit to using the keywords meta tag because no search engines use it.  Some websites have a site search feature that may use that tag, depending on how it's configured, but it will do nothing for getting your site ranked on Google.
Using meta tags for keywords can have several benefits for your SEO and user experience. Search engines can use your keywords as signals of your page's topic and content, helping them index and rank your page more accurately and relevantly. Additionally, users can see your keywords in the search results and decide if your page matches their intent and needs, making it easier and quicker for them to find your page. Furthermore, you can target your audience more effectively and increase your traffic and conversions by attracting more qualified and interested visitors who are looking for your keywords.
